## How to run the script

The `run_analysis.R` script does not depend on third-party packages.
You should be able to simply run it without problems:

    ~ $ git clone ...
    ~ $ cd datasciencecoursera/getdata-012/course-project/
    course-project $ R -f run_analysis.R
    
Please make sure to set your current directory to the `datasciencecoursera/getdata-012/course-project/` directory before running the script (if you're using RStudio, you can do so from by clicking *Session > Set working directory > Choose directory...* in the menus.
